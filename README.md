#📌 Demand Forecasting System for FMCG Retailer

##🚀 Overview

This project is an end-to-end demand forecasting system designed to help an FMCG retailer optimize inventory management. The system predicts weekly demand for different product categories using time-series forecasting and machine learning models (XGBoost, LSTM, ARIMA), ensuring optimal stock levels and reducing business losses due to overstocking and understocking.

##🔥 Problem Statement

📉 Challenge: The retailer faces significant losses due to poor inventory management:

Overstocking leads to high storage costs and wastage.

Understocking results in lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.

##🎯 Objective: Develop a robust forecasting model to predict weekly demand, enabling data-driven inventory planning and efficient supply chain management.

##🏗️ Project Methodology (CRISP-DM Framework)

##📊 Business Understanding: Identify inventory challenges and define forecasting objectives.

##📂 Data Understanding: Collect and analyze historical sales, product, and store data.

##🛠 Data Preparation: Perform EDA, time-series feature engineering (lags, moving averages).

##🤖 Modeling & Evaluation: Train and evaluate forecasting models (ARIMA, XGBoost, LSTM).

##🌎 Deployment: Develop a Streamlit-based web app on AWS for real-time demand forecasting.

##🗂 Data Sources

📦 Datasets Used:

🛍 Product Data: UPC, description, manufacturer, category.

📈 Sales Data: Weekly sales, discounts, promotions, pricing.

🏪 Store Data: Location, size, market segmentation.

🔗 Data Integration: SQL in BigQuery for a unified dataset.

##🔮 Forecasting Models

📡 ARIMA/SARIMA: Traditional time-series models.

🚀 XGBoost: Advanced ML-based forecasting.

🧠 LSTM: Deep learning for sequential sales patterns.

📊 Evaluation Metric: RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error) for better handling of demand variations.

🔄 Inventory Optimization Techniques

✅ Linear & Non-Linear Optimization for stock planning.

🎲 Monte Carlo Simulations for uncertainty analysis.

🚚 Route Optimization for efficient supply chain management.
